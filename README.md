# Image Classification Using Pre-trained VGG16

This project demonstrates the use of a **pre-trained VGG16 model** for image classification using **transfer learning**.  
The model leverages learned features from ImageNet and adapts them for a custom image classification task.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Uses **VGG16 pre-trained model**
- Applies **transfer learning**
- Freezes base layers to improve efficiency
- Adds custom classification layers
- Suitable for **academic and learning purposes**

## 🧠 Model Used

- **VGG16**
- Pre-trained on **ImageNet**
- `include_top=False` is used to remove original classification layers
